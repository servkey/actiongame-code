    <h1>Map editing</h1>
    <h2>Introduction...</h2>
    <p>
      To begin map editing, while in AssaultCube, press the letter <b>E</b> which toggles editmode. AssaultCubes map editor is built into the client,
      so its easy to learn and you don't need to download any special tools to get started. In editmode, you can fly around in any direction you 
      like and you can even go through walls. This is to make map-editing easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      In editmode, you will see a grid being drawn where ever you point. Each of these small squares is a single cube. The cubes in 
      AssaultCube are known as "geometery". The blue lines indicate a selection of 8x8 cubes. You will also see some blue sparkly things. 
      These sparkly things are known as "entities" (which will be explained later). Click and drag the small white box at your crosshair over
      some cubes (you will see a red box over what you are selecting). This is how you select geometery.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to start creating a new map, type: <i>/newmap</i> and then the size you would like (7 is the sensible default) and 
      then press enter. You can save your map at any time by typing: <i>/savemap</i> and then the name you would like it saved as. The map gets
      saved in the <i>packages/maps</i> directory. Save your map often, to avoid the frustration of losing all of your work if something goes wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Make sure when you start a map, to use the <i>/newmap</i> command, rather than editing an existing map, otherwise your map may get saved
      a bit strangely. Also note: you cannot put spaces or any illegal characters in the name you save it as.
    </p>

      Below are the controls that get used in map-editing...

      To load your map, type /map and the file name you chose for your map. If you have not placed lighting in your map yet, your map will turn up dark. 
      To temporarily fix this problem, type: <i>/fullbright 1</i>  - this will fill your whole map with light. The fullbright command only works in edit
      mode and is not a permanent fix. To remove fullbright mode, type: <i>/recalc</i>. 
      Note: These commands can be found in the lighting menu (press <b>L</b>).
