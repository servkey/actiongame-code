can i use these textures for free?
you can use any texture for personal or school projects without my permission. however if you decide to distribute your work i would appreciate credit where credit is due.

where can i not use these textures?
any webpage, program, or texture cd that has them available without my permission is not permitted. you can however use them in a design scheme for your site.

what's with the update delays?
since i'm a full time student and freelance web designer, it's a little hard for me to find time to get out and take pictures (especially since i live in arizona and it's 500 degrees outside). lately though i've been trying a lot harder to put a lot more work into the sites content.
