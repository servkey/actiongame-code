    Learning how to play AssaultCube is easy. After knowing the controls, most things are relatively 
    straight forward.
  </p>   
  <p>
      To play, press <b>W</b> to move forwards and then move your mouse around to change directions. Left-click
      when aimed at an enemy to attack them. Most other moves you can use to further your abilities and fun are covered below...

    <p>
      You can find a list of controls used in map editing <a href="mapeditingintro.xml#controls">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons by using the keybinding menu in-game.
      This can be found by pressing ESCAPE and then navigating to: settings &rArr; keyboard/mouse controls.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting a singleplayer game</h2>
    <p>
      This is simple. Just press ESC and then navigate to <b>Singleplayer</b>, then choose the mode, bot skill,
      amount of enemies and the map. Then, a game with computer-bot enemies will start immediately.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Joining a multiplayer game
    </h2> 
    <p>
      In game, press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Refresh Server List</i>. The
      masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers. Do so every
      few days, to add newly created servers to your list. The list of servers are saved in
      <i>config/servers.cfg</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <a href="interface.xml#hud">console</a> says "master server not replying", then 
      that means your client failed to download the list of servers to play upon, and you may have to try 
      downloading them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you updated your server list, you can use <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Join a game</i>.
      Simply select a server (use up/down arrows or scrolling) and then press ENTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly by typing <i>/connect </i> and then 
      a valid IP or DNS name of a server and optionally, a password, if the server uses one.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Changing settings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most important setting changes can actually be changed from within the menus. So, press <b>ESC</b> and then <b>settings</b>. 
      There are many settings in this menu that can be changed, look in there for what you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are of course other settings which can't be found inside the menu. These settings can be changed via the console. Check out
      the <a href="reference.xml">reference</a> to find out about those settings and how they can be changed.
    </p>

    <h2>
      How settings are saved
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a file called <i>defaults.cfg</i> in the <i>config</i> directory. When you run
      AssaultCube for the first time it will execute this file. Once you quit AssaultCube,
      the default settings and your changes created upon them during the course of the game
      (and from your autoexec.cfg) will be stored in <i>config/saved.cfg</i>. 
      If you want to reset your settings to default values just delete <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
      Alternatively, you can delete it using the menus, by pressing ESCAPE and going into: Settings &rArr; 
      Reset all settings? &rArr; Reset ALL settings and restart AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are commands that you would like executed every time AssaultCube starts, you can insert
      these scripting commands into <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When AssaultCube is started, it will check for the file <i>config/init.cfg</i>. If it does not exist
      then AssaultCube assumes this is the first time you have ran AssaultCube and will prompt you with the 
      "quick setup" menu. This contains settings for you to change that are important for running AssaultCube. 
      Such as screen resolution, mouse sensitivity, nickname, etc. When you press "OK", then AssaultCube will restart to 
      allow those settings to take effect. The <i>config/init.cfg</i> file saves settings that can only be 
      changed before AssaultCube runs, so when AssaultCube first starts, it will execute those settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note for linux users: Config files get saved in the hidden directory <i>.assaultcube/config</i> 
      in your users home directory.
