      Interface
    </h2>
    <p>
      In game, press ESC to access the main menu. From there you can do all sorts of actions,
      like joining multiplayer games and changing settings. As example, in the <i>
        Team/Player
        Setup
      </i> submenu, you can choose your team and skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The menu covers the most important actions. Further customizations and actions can
      be done using CubeScript: To get a console press T to open up the chat prompt. You
      can use it as console if you put a &ldquo;<span class="code">/</span>&rdquo; (slash)
      at its beginning followed by a command. As example, type this command into the console:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      crosshairsize 25
    </div>
    <p>
      This will increase the size of your crosshair. Check the 
      <a href="reference.xml#section_Game_Reference">reference</a>
      to see all gameplay relevant commands you can use
      through CubeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hint: Press F11 to get a bigger console history.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Saving Settings
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is the file <i>defaults.cfg</i> in the <i>config</i> directory. If you run
      AssaultCube for the first time it will execute this file. Once you quit AssaultCube,
      the default settings and your changes on them will be stored to <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
      If you want to reset your settings to the default values just delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edit the <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i> file and insert scripting commands you want
      to execute on every start of the game.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Setting Your Name
    </h2>
    <p>
      Open the console as described above and type the following command:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      name yourname
    </div>
    <p>
      where <i>yourname</i> is your desired name.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Joining a Game
    </h2>
    <p>
      In game, press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Refresh Server List</i>. The
      masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers. Do so every
      few days, to add newly created servers to your list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you updated your server list, you can use <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Serverbrowser</i>.
      Simply select a server (up-/downarrow) and press return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly using this command:
    </p>
    <div class="code">
      connect N P
    </div>
    <p>
      Where N is a valid IP or FQDN and P a password (optional).
    </p>
