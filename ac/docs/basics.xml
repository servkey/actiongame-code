  <h2>Game objective</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Find the enemy.
    </li>
    <li>
      Frag or gib the enemy.
    </li>
    <li>

  <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
  <p>
    Learning how to play AssaultCube is easy. After knowing the controls, most things are relatively 
    straight forward.
  </p>   
  <p>
      To play, press <b>W</b> to move forwards and then move your mouse around to change directions. Left-click
      when aimed at an enemy to attack them. Most other moves you can use to further your abilities and fun are covered below...

    <p>
      You can find a list of controls used in map editing <a href="mapeditingintro.xml#controls">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons by using the keybinding menu in-game.
      This can be found by pressing ESCAPE and then navigating to: settings &rArr; keyboard/mouse controls.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting a singleplayer game</h2>
    <p>
      This is simple. Just press ESC and then navigate to <b>Singleplayer</b>, then choose the mode, bot skill,
      amount of enemies and the map. Then, a game with computer-bot enemies will start immediately.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Joining a multiplayer game
    </h2> 
    <p>
      In game, press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Refresh Server List</i>. The
      masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers. Do so every
      few days, to add newly created servers to your list. The list of servers are saved in
      <i>config/servers.cfg</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the <a href="interface.xml#hud">console</a> says "master server not replying", then 
      that means your client failed to download the list of servers to play upon, and you may have to try 
      downloading them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you updated your server list, you can use <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Join a game</i>.
      Simply select a server (use up/down arrows or scrolling) and then press ENTER.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly by typing <i>/connect </i> and then 
      a valid IP or DNS name of a server and optionally, a password, if the server uses one.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Changing settings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most important setting changes can actually be changed from within the menus. So, press <b>ESC</b> and then <b>settings</b>. 
      There are many important settings in this menu that can be changed, including changing your name and team. Look in there for what you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are of course other settings which can't be found inside the menu. These settings can be changed via the console. Check out
      the <a href="reference.xml">reference</a> to find out about those settings and how they can be changed.
    </p>

    <h2>
      How settings are saved
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is a file called <i>defaults.cfg</i> in the <i>config</i> directory. When you run
      AssaultCube for the first time it will execute this file. Once you quit AssaultCube,
      the default settings and your changes created upon them during the course of the game
      (and from your autoexec.cfg) will be stored in <i>config/saved.cfg</i>. 
      If you want to reset your settings to default values just delete <i>config/saved.cfg</i>.
      Alternatively, you can delete it using the menus, by pressing ESCAPE and going into: Settings &rArr; 
      Reset all settings? &rArr; Reset ALL settings and restart AC.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are commands that you would like executed every time AssaultCube starts, you can insert
      these scripting commands into <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When AssaultCube is started, it will check for the file <i>config/init.cfg</i>. If it does not exist
      then AssaultCube assumes this is the first time you have ran AssaultCube and will prompt you with the 
      "quick setup" menu. This contains settings for you to change that are important for running AssaultCube. 
      Such as screen resolution, mouse sensitivity, nickname, etc. When you press "OK", then AssaultCube will restart to 
      allow those settings to take effect. The <i>config/init.cfg</i> file saves settings that can only be 
      changed before AssaultCube runs, so when AssaultCube first starts, it will execute those settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note for linux users: Config files get saved in the hidden directory <i>.assaultcube/config</i> 
      in your users home directory.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Choosing a weapon
    </h2>
    <p>
      <img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;margin-bottom:5px;" src="pics/weaponselect.jpg" />
      To select a primary weapon, press B to show the weapon menu (you can also find this menu inside of the 
      settings menu).<br />
      This menu will give you the option to pick any of the four primary weapons (Assault rifle, Sniper
      rifle, Sub-machine gun, Shotgun).
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time respawn, you will start with the weapon that you selected from this menu.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also select between your primary weapon, pistol/akimbo, grenade or knife by selecting them 
      using the keys 1-4, or by scrolling through them with your mouse. Also, G will throw a grenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Quick nade throw</b>: If you want to throw a grenade and then quickly switch back to your normal weapon,
      press and hold the right mouse button and then let go to throw the grenade. After throwing the grenade (if you clicked and
      held it) then it will switch back to your normal weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find out more about the weapons <a href="introduction.xml#weapons">here</a>.
    </p>
      <img style="float:right;margin-left:10px;" src="pics/smallminimap.jpg" />
    <h2 style="margin-top:30px;">
      Orientation
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you can't find your way around the map, you can use the mini-map in the top-right corner of your screen (see right).
      Also, a bigger version of the map can be shown by pressing <b>ALT</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To learn more about the mini-map, see <a href="interface.xml#minimap">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2 style="margin-top:25px;">
      Scoreboard
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can see the scoreboard by pressing <b>TAB</b>. More information about the scoreboard can be found <a href="interface.xml#scoreboard">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Talking/Chatting
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you want to say something to other players, it's very simple. Just press <b>T</b> to bring up the console
      where you can type what you would like to the other players.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to make sure what you say is said only to the players on your team (if in a team mode), then press <b>U</b>.
      This will bring up the console with a <i>%</i> sign in-front of it. The <i>%</i> sign is what is needed infront of <i>ANYTHING</i>
      you say to make it be seen <i>ONLY</i> by your team.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Gibs
    </h2>
    <p>
      <i>Gibs</i> are a great way of defeating another player. If you want to gain a lot of points fast, this is the way to do it, because
      gibs count for <b>2</b> points!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibs are created by: Headshots from sniper rifles, deaths from knifing &amp; deaths from grenade blasts.
    </p>
    <h2 id="voting">
      Voting
    </h2>
    <p>
      Voting can be used to do many various things in Multiplayer. Such as changing mode/map, forcing a team change, changing mastermode, 
      kick or ban a player, setting autoteam and removing bans.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can make these votes through the menus in:  Multiplayer &rArr; Server voting
      <br /> ...or by simply typing the command, i.e. <i>/ctf ac_mines</i> would start a vote for ac_mines in CTF mode.<br />
      <b>Note</b>: You can only start a vote every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use <b>F1</b> to vote for votes that appear at the bottom left of your screen and use <b>F2</b> to vote against them.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Spectating
    </h2>
    <p>
      After you get fragged, you can spectate a game simply by pressing the space bar. Using your mouse to scroll will change the
      player you are spectating. Pressing the space bar will scroll through 3 different spectate modes: Normal spectate, follow-player or 
      follow with ghost (the person you are spectating becomes transparent to you).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Voice-com
    </h2>
    <p>
      To use the voice-coms during a multiplayer game, press <b>V</b>.<br /> Then using numbers, select the voice-com you would like to say. <br />
      Alternatively, you can go through: Multiplayer &rArr; VoiceCom.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Screenshots
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can create a screenshot, at anytime during the game by pressing <b>F12</b>, or by typing <b>/screenshot</b>. Most players use
      screenshots as a way of keeping a record of their scores.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Demos
    </h2>
    <p>
      Demos are a little bit like video recordings of the game. Because of how they work, they're small files, so don't worry about file-sizes.
      To start a demo in-game, use the menu and navigate to: <i>Demos &rArr; record demo</i>. A vote will be made to record a demo for the next match.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next match, a recording will be made and you can vote to stop recording the demo at any time through: <i>Demos &rArr; Stop recording/playback</i>.
      When the demo stops being recorded you will be prompted to download it by pressing <b>F10</b> and if pressed your demo will be downloaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to download a previous demo that's still located on the server, you can use: <i>Demos &rArr; List demos</i> in the menus. 
      Then, type <i>/getdemo X</i> but replace <b>X</b> for the number for the demo that you want to download from the server. If you use getdemo 
      from the menus, it will only download the last created demo on the server.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Playing and sending custom maps
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you want to play a custom map online, then there are two things you must do...
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Firstly:</b> Start the map - This is done by voting for the map and mode to be played. 
      This can be done through the menus as shown in <a href="#voting">voting</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Secondly:</b> Send the map - This is done by typing <i>/sendmap</i> and the maps name. This will send the map file for 
      the map stored on your computer to all the other players so that you can properly play the map. If the 
      map has a config file, it will send that also.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Reset binds
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you would like to reset all your controls back to the defaults, you can type the <b>/resetbinds</b> command.
      Alternatively, you can find this inside <b>settings &rArr; Keyboard/mouse controls</b> by choosing <b>Reset binds to defaults</b>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Reset configs
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you would like to be able to reset all settings <u>AND</u> controls to default values, you can do this easily by typing <b>/resetcfg</b>.
      You can find this inside the <b>settings</b> menu by selecting <b>Reset all settings</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This command will delete the saved.cfg and the init.cfg file which contains all the settings for AssaultCube.
    </p>    
    <h2>
      Console
    </h2>
    <p>
      The console shows you messages from the game at the top-left corner of your screen. It also displays chat from other players.
      If you find that the console is moving too fast for you and you missed an important message that you would like to read, you can 
      extend the console by pressing <b>F11</b>. You can also scroll up through the message by pressing the minus <b>-</b> key on your keypad.
    </p>
    <p>
      More information about the console can be found <a href="interface.xml#console">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      In-game reference
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you would like to see a reference of commands during the game, you can access these 
      through the menu by going through: Help &rArr; AssaultCube reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you know the command you would like to use, but just want some information about it, you can type the command into AssaultCube 
      and information about this command will be displayed. You can disable this documentation reference if you want by pressing F1 when it is shown.
