  <h1>Common F.A.Q's</h1>
  <p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <i>This section of the ReadMe covers some common questions asked by players.</i>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>What is ping/packet jump?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    This is covered in the interface part of the readme. Check <a href="interface.xml#scoreboard">here</a>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Why do some players become transparent and salute?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    This is because of lag. The server has not had a response from this player for too long and so they have 
    temporarally been turned into a "ghost" that cannot be shot (but don't worry, they can't shoot you either).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Someones name on the scoreboard is coloured red... why is this?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-left:20px;">
    This is because they are the administrator. This means they know the password to the server, probably because they own the server, 
    or are a friend of the person who owns the server, and because of this, they can do what they like on THEIR SERVER. Administrators overide all 
    normal player votes.
