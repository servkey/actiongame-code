        Setting up a Server
    </h1>
<h2>The AssaultCube Server</h2>
<p>
        Dedicated servers run in the shell only (no graphics), with increased priority yet use very little cpu time and memory, 
        so you can run one in the background, or at the same time with a client if you want to host a game. Server port is 
        fixed at <b>28763</b>, with <b>28764</b> being used for the server info requests (both UDP). 
        See the <a href="getstarted.html" shape="rect">Get Started Guide</a> to find out how to join a server.
    </p>
<h2>Main Configuration</h2>
<p>
        The AssaultCube server is mainly configured using command line options set in the server script <i>assaultcube_server.bat</i> on windows or 
        <i>assaultcube_server.sh</i> on linux. 
    </p>
<div class="code">
        bin_win32\ac_server.exe -c8 -n"My AC Server"
    </div>
<p>
        Possible command line options can be obtained from the <a href="commandline.html" shape="rect">command-line section</a> of this documentation.
        Run the script to start the server.
    </p>
<h2 id="maprotation">Maprotation</h2>
<p>
        In the maprotation file specified on the command line (default: <i>config/maprot.cfg</i>), you can specify
        the map, mode, time and voting for your server. Each line defines one round. Example:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    // server side maprotations
    // WARNING: You can NOT use CubeScript in there
    // use the following scheme:
    // map:mode:time:allowVote

    // tdm
    ac_complex:0:10:1
    ac_depot:0:10:1
    ac_desert:0:10:1
    ac_mines:0:10:1

    // ctf
    ac_mines:5:10:1
    ac_depot:5:10:1
    </pre>
<p>
        The first line, <span class="code">ac_complex:0:10:1</span>, means, the map <i>ac_complex</i> is played 
        in mode 0 (Team Deathmatch) for 10 minutes. The connected players are allowed to vote.
    </p>
<h1>Administration</h1>
<h2>Cheating</h2>
<p>
        Cheating is a problem that can't be solved entirely. 
        AssaultCube is opensource, so everyone that knows how to compile it can easily modify the source to do whatever he wants, 
        thats the problem of opensource games. The fact that the whole game logic is client-side, to save a lot bandwith, makes it even easier to cheat.
        There is no way to avoid this abuse.
    </p>
<h2 id="serveradmin">Server Admin</h2>
<p>
      There is a client role a player can claim called <i>admin</i>. 
      It can be claimed by the real owner of a server to take control over what is happening when they are present.
      Claiming admin state requires a password that matches the server configuration.
    </p>
<p>
      Related commands:
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
        <a href="reference.html#identifier_setadmin" shape="rect">setadmin</a> - become admin on a server
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="reference.html#identifier_connectadmin" shape="rect">connectadmin</a> - connect to a server and become admin
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="reference.html#identifier_giveadmin" shape="rect">giveadmin</a> - gives the master state to a player
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>
      Use the <span class="code">setadmin</span> command to claim admin if you are already connected to a sever.
      However if you are locked out of your own server because you are banned, master mode is private or because all
      client slots are taken, you can use the <span class="code">connectadmin</span> command to get control
      back though. If you want to leave the server in the hands of a certain player <span class="code">giveadmin</span> can be used
      to give control to a honest player.
    </p>
<p>
      The admin password is configured using the <a href="startup.html" shape="rect">-x command-line option</a>.
