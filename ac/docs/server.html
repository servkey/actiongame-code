                    Dedicated servers run in the shell only (no graphics), with increased priority
                    yet use very little cpu time and memory, so you can run one in the background,
                    or at the same time with a client if you want to host a game. Server ports default to
                    UDP <b>28763</b> (game) and <b>28764</b> (info). If you choose to set your own port as X
					it will automatically use X+1 for the info port! 
					See the <a href="getstarted.html" shape="rect">Get Started Guide</a> to find out 
					how to join a server.

                <p>
                    You can use three different schemes to specify IP address ranges:

                    If a player from a banned IP address tries to connect to your server, he will get an

                    In the above example three passwords are defined: <i>Lorem</i>, <i>ipsum</i> and <i>dolor</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>ipsum</i> and <i>dolor</i> are full admin passwords. They can be used to claim admin, connect
                    to a full server and to get over a server ban.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Lorem</i> is a less powerful password: it can only be used to connect to a server that has a pending
                    ban on the user. This kind of password is useful, whenever a blacklist range ban affects innocent players.

                <p>
                    Cheating is a problem that can't be solved entirely. AssaultCube is opensource,
                    so everyone that knows how to compile it can easily modify the source to do
                    whatever he wants, thats the problem of opensource games. The fact that the
                    whole game logic is client-side, to save a lot bandwith, makes it even easier
                    to cheat. There is no way to avoid this abuse.

                <p>
                    There is a client role a player can claim called <i>admin</i>. It can be
                    claimed by the real owner of a server to take control over what is happening
                    when they are present. Claiming admin state requires a password that matches
                    the server configuration.

                    because you are banned, master mode is private or because all client slots are
                    taken, you can use the <span class="code">connectadmin</span> command to get
                    control back though. If you want to leave the server in the hands of a certain
                    player <span class="code">giveadmin</span> can be used to give control to a
                    honest player.
