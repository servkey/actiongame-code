        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        
        <h3>Setting resolution</h3>
        
        <p>
            The default resolution is 1024x768. If you need to change it, modify <i>actioncube.bat</i> accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            -w sets width<br />
            -h sets height
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In linux, simply pass those parameters in the command line or add them to the <i>actioncube.sh</i> shell script. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Setting your name</h3>
        <p>
            Open <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i> and search for the line
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">name unarmed</div>
        
        <p>
            replace <i>unarmed</i> with your own nickname.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Hint:</b> The <i>autoexec.cfg</i> provides comments and suggestions for further customization.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        
        <h3 style="clear:both">Interface</h3>

        <p>
            In game, press ESC to access the main menu. From there you can do all sort of actions, like joining multiplayer games and changing settings.
            As example, in the <i>Team/Player Setup</i> submenu, you can choose your team and skin.
        </p>

        <p>
            The menu covers the most important actions. Further customizations and actions can be done using CubeScript: To get a console
            press T  to open up the chat prompt. You can use it as console if you put a &ldquo;<span class="code">/</span>&rdquo; (slash) at its beginning followed by a command. 
            As example, type this into the console:
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">
            /crosshairsize 25
        </div>
        
        <p>
            This will increase the size of your crosshair. <i>All changes</i> done by the menu or using this console will be lost once you quit the game.
            To store such settings for good, make your customizations in <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Joining a Game</h3>
        
        <p>
            In game, press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Refresh Server List</i>. The masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers. 
            Do so every few days, to add newly created servers to your list.
        </p>            
        
        <p>
            Once you updated your server list, you can use <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Serverbrowser</i>.
            Simply select a server (up-/downarrow) and press return.   
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly using this command:
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">
            connect N
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Where N is a valid IP or FQDN.
        </p>
