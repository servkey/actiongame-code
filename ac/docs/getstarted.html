        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        
        <h3>System Requirements</h3>
        
        <p>
            If your Cube installation runs fine, ActionCube does too.<br />
            Minimum specs: P-III 500 Mhz with gf1/radeon or better.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Recommended gfx setting for low/medium machines:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>800x600@16bpp</li>
            <li>Antialiasing: OFF</li>
            <li>Anisotropic Filtering:OFF</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Linux users: Make sure you have <i>libSDL 1.2</i>, <i>libSDL_image</i> and <i>libSDL_mixer</i> installed.
        </p>        
        
        <h3>Setting Resolution</h3>
        
        <p>
            The default resolution is 1024x768. If you need to change it, modify <i>actioncube.bat</i> accordingly, e.g.:
        </p>
        <p>
            -w800 -h600
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In linux, simply pass those parameters in the command line or add them to the <i>actioncube.sh</i> shell script. 
            Check the <a href="config.html#commandline">config section</a> to see all available command-line options.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Running the game</h3>
        
        <p>
            Windows: Start the <i>actioncube.bat</i>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Linux: cd to the main actioncube directory and execute <i>actioncube.sh</i>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Basics</h2>
        
        <h3 style="clear:both">Interface</h3>

        <p>
            In game, press ESC to access the main menu. From there you can do all sorts of actions, like joining multiplayer games and changing settings.
            As example, in the <i>Team/Player Setup</i> submenu, you can choose your team and skin.
        </p>

        <p>
            The menu covers the most important actions. Further customizations and actions can be done using CubeScript: To get a console
            press T  to open up the chat prompt. You can use it as console if you put a &ldquo;<span class="code">/</span>&rdquo; (slash) at its beginning followed by a command. 
            As example, type this command into the console:
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">
            crosshairsize 25
        </div>
        
        <p>
            This will increase the size of your crosshair. Check the <a href="gamecommands.html">game commands section</a> to see
            all gameplay relevant commands you can use through CubeScript.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Saving Settings</h3>
        
        <p>
            There is the file <i>defaults.cfg</i> in the <i>config</i> directory. If you run ActionCube for the first time 
            it will execute this file. Once you quit ActionCube, the default settings and your changes on them will be 
            stored to <i>config/saved.cfg</i>. If you want to reset your settings to the default values just delete it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Edit the <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i> file and insert scripting commands you want to execute on every start of the game.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Setting Your Name</h3>
        
        <p>
            Open the console as described above and type the following command:
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">name yourname</div>
        
        <p>
            where <i>yourname</i> is your desired name.
        </p>
       
        
        <h3>Joining a Game</h3>
        
        <p>
            In game, press ESC and choose <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Refresh Server List</i>. The masterserver will be queried and provide you with a list of servers. 
            Do so every few days, to add newly created servers to your list.
        </p>            
        
        <p>
            Once you updated your server list, you can use <i>Multiplayer &rArr; Serverbrowser</i>.
            Simply select a server (up-/downarrow) and press return.   
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Alternatively, you can connect to a server directly using this command:
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">
            connect N P
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Where N is a valid IP or FQDN and P a password (optional).
        </p>
