  CubeRef Recommendations
  
    General
      * see the xml schemas for details on the elements
      * do not use any xml editor that rapes the formatting
      * do not write tutorial-like content, this is a reference. therefore focus on the 
        technical description of identifiers as a single unit
      * use a CDATA section for content that requires special characters
  
    Sections
      * a section represents a group of identifiers
      * chose sections based on the usage areas of identifiers
  
      Identifiers
        * an identifier represents a command, variable or an alias that is available through cubescript
        * identifiers must be unique across sections
        * custom aliases located in default.cfg must not be documented
        
        Description
          * provide a short an concise description of what the identifier does or represents, omit details
      
        Arguments
          * use a single character token if possible
          * keep the argument description simple, write a remark for details
          * write restricted integer values in the way of 0..3 (0 to 3) and 1..* (0 to 'infinite')
          * if no restrictions apply to values, specify the pseudo data type
          * if the meaning of the arguments depends on other arguments, create multiple identifiers
            with the name containing the depending argument. example: 'newent type v1 v2 v3 v4' depends 
            on the type, therefore it's split to 'newent light', 'newent ammo', etc.
            
        Remarks
          * describe details and special behavior
          * give _short_ examples if needed
          
        References
          * refer to other identifiers that are _directly_ related
          * refer to _official_ online sources like the wiki
          * name other (offline) sources without url or identifier
