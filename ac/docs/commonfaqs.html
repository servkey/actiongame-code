<h1>Common F.A.Q's</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom:20px;">
    <i>This section of the ReadMe covers some common questions asked by players.</i>
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <b>What is ping/packet jump?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
    This is covered in the interface part of the readme. Check <a href="interface.html#scoreboard" shape="rect">here</a>.
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <b>Why do some players become transparent and salute?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
    This is because of lag. The server has not had a response from this player for too long and so they have 
    temporarally been turned into a "ghost" that cannot be shot (but don't worry, they can't shoot you either).
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <b>Someones name on the scoreboard is coloured red... why is this?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
    This is because they are the administrator. This means they know the password to the server, probably because they own the server, 
    or are a friend of the person who owns the server, and because of this, they can do what they like on THEIR SERVER. Administrators overide all 
    normal player votes.
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <b>I experience some motion sickness... any way around this?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
    Try increasing your <b>Field of View</b> or resolution. You can change the resolution through the <b>Quick setup</b> menu in settings. Field of View can be found in <b>Video settings</b> in the settings menu.
  </p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <b>What's a good way to get a lot of points, fast?</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">
    If you try "<a href="basics.html#gib" shape="rect">gibbing</a>" an enemy, you would get 2 points for that. Try honing your skills onto gibbing and that may help you.
