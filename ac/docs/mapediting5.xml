    <h1>Map editing: Config files</h1>
    
    <p>
     When you first start a map, be sure to use the <b>/newmap</b> command, rather than editing 
     an existing map.
     Issuing the <i>newmap</i> command ensures that your map uses the default map settings, rather than 
     using the existing configuration for that map (if it did use the existing configuration, upon 2nd load, the map will become messed up).
   </p>
   <p>
     Map config files will <b>ONLY</b> be needed if you want to utilize any of the below:
     <ul>
       <li>
         <a href="#textures">Custom textures</a>
       </li>
       <li>
         <a href="#models">Custom mapmodels</a>
         <ol>
           <li>
             Custom "nothing" clips
           </li>
         </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
         Custom skymaps
       </li>
       <li>
         Custom watercolouring or water textures
       </li>
       <li>
         Custom fog distances and colours
       </li>
       <li>
         Ambient sounds
       </li>
       <li>
         Using the "loadnotexture" command
       </li>
     </ul>
     The first step to using any of the above in your map is copying the 
     <a href="../config/default_map_settings.cfg">/config/default_map_settings.cfg</a> file into your 
     <a href="../packages/maps">/packages/maps</a> folder
     and then renaming it to the same name as what your map will be called (i.e. foobar.cfg). 
     Whenever your map is loaded, it will look for your maps config file (which it can only 
     find if it's named the same as your map). If it can't find 
     the config file for your map, it will automatically load 
     <a href="../config/default_map_settings.cfg">the default config</a> instead.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Warning:</b> <u>PLEASE</u> be aware when adding custom content to your map, to make sure you use 
     <u>LOWERCASE</u> through out the config file and make sure file names of your custom content also use lower case.
     If you don't, some operating systems such as linux, will not load the commands or files due to the fact that an
     uppercase letter in linux is counted as a completely different letter to a lower case letter. So it is absolutely
     vital that the filenames match (even in the file-name extension!)
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Warning:</b> Don't use single slashes in the config file to issue commands, as the commands won't work if you do.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Note:</b> You may see "comments" in the config files. Comments are lines of wiriting in the config file that
     have had 2 forward-slashes put in front of them. Using comments is a good way to advise the reader of the config 
     file about things in the config file. Comments are ignored by the AssaultCube engine. Below is an example of a comment:<br />
     <b>// This is a comment!</b>
   </p>
   
   <h2 id="textures">Custom textures</h2>
   <p>
     When you want to add custom textures to your config file, be sure that the textures tile seamlessly.
     This means that your texture, when lined up against itself in all directions, should match itself.
   </p>
   <p>
     Preferably, textures should be 256x256 pixels. But, each cube in AssaultCube measures 32x32 pixels, so, as
     long as the image is a multiple of 32 pixels and doesn't take up too much space, the texture should work fine.
     When creating/using custom textures, remember that too much detail/size could make that texture in the map too laggy!
   </p>
   <p>
     You will notice in the default config a command "texturereset". This ensures that all the textures
     in your map are always shown in the correct order, so make sure you leave this where it is! Textures are in a numbered
     list and the "texturereset" command resets that list. The first and second textures in the list are hardcoded as the 
     skymap and water textures.
   </p> 
   <p>
     You are allowed to add new textures anywhere below where it says 
     <b>//-----brickwalls-------</b> Putting it above this will
     create some problems. If you are just starting your map, it would be fine to replace textures in the list, or slot
     your textures anywhere between the current texture list. However, if you have already started your map and are just 
     now adding a new texture, it would be wise to place your texture at the very end of the list, so that your map does
     not get messed up!
   </p>
   <p>
     To add a new texture, use this format: <b>texture 0 "./folder/file.jpg"</b> on a single line. 
     Replace "folder" with the folder name and "file" with the name of the image. Be sure to put all your content
     inside a seperate folder so that it does not get mixed in with everyone elses content. 
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Note:</b> All textures <b>MUST</b> be placed inside <a href="../packages/textures">/packages/textures/</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Warning:</b> There can only be maximum of 256 textures in your map! Any more won't be loaded.
   </p>
   
   <h2 id="models">Custom mapmodels</h2>
   <p>
     To use your own custom mapmodels in AssaultCube, all models must be of either md2 or md3 format and 
     be placed inside <a href="../packages/models/mapmodels">/packages/models/mapmodels</a>. You will need
     to create a seperate folder for your mapmodel. Inside it, you will need to place the model with the name "tris" 
     (and the .md2 or .md3 extension). You will also need to place the skin in the same folder with the name "skin.jpg".

<!-- 

TO DO: 

* loadnotexture 
* loadsky + Adv of the different parts of a skybox (1st texture in list)
* mapmodelreset + mapmodel + clips/clipping
* fog + fogcolour
* mapsound
* watercolour + watertexture (2nd texture in list)
 - Ask driAn about dummy texture..
