    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Story</h2>

    <p>
        Well, there's no story. This game is basically about these two teams fighting each other:
    </p>

    <p>
        <b id="cla">The Cubers Liberations Army (CLA)</b><br />

        <img src="pics/flag_cla.jpg" alt="CLA" style="float:right"/>
        
        Little is known about the goals and motivation of this small but feared Terrorist group. Their activities are 
        as diverse as their members. With ex-military, anarchists, religious fanatics, conspiracy theorists, hippies 
        stuck tripping, free &copy; software fanatics&trade; or simply severely mental disordered persons and bored youngsters, this organization is a 
        pool of radicals from across the globe. Their operations range from simple annoyances (such as introducing 
        large amounts of Marijuana smoke into the air conditioners of offices or malls) to well planned gruesome 
        bombings. They'll target civilians as well as politicians, lobbyists or religious leaders and their employees. 
        <i>&ldquo;Terror for the sake of terror, for you all suck!&rdquo;</i> seems to be their motto.                   
    </p>

    <p>
        <b id="rvsf">The Rabid Viper Special Forces (RVSF)</b><br />

        <img src="pics/flag_rvsf.jpg" alt="RVSF" style="float:right"/> 
        
        An elite group of armed special forces, but not the kind you´d expect. These guys are battle worn fighters 
        and mercenaries, who might've been just a little too trigger happy and up for the glory to fit into any other 
        kind of elite squad. They're not suitable where lives are to be spared and private or public property to remain 
        unharmed. The backgrounds and funders of this extravagant task-force remain well concealed for obvious 
        reasons. Their primary targets are highly unpredictable terrorists and organized criminals such as the CLA 
        where intelligence, infiltration and stealth would be just a waste of time. <i>&ldquo;First shoot, then ask 
        questions later, if anyone´s left to ask&rdquo;</i> is the primary approach to their job.  
    </p>
    <h2 id="weapons">Weapons</h2>

    <p>
        There are seven weapons you can use to frag or gib your enemies:
    </p>            

    <table id="guns">
        <tr>
            <td width="140"><img src="pics/weapon_knife.jpg" alt="Knife"/></td>
            <td>
                <b>Swiss Tech Combat Blade DR-88</b><br />
                <p>
                    A sharp and swift blade. It is your last resort when you ran out of ammo as well as your best friend
                    in humiliating snipers and campers. Fragging someone using this weapon produces a "gib" instead of a
                    frag which counts for two frags, instead of one. (0)
                </p>                        
            </td>
        </tr>
       <tr>
            <td><img src="pics/weapon_pistol.jpg" alt="Pistol"/></td>
            <td>
                <b>Mk-77 Semi-Automatic Pistol</b><br />
                <p>
                    You basic sidearm. A powerful resort weapon, yet typically less effective at range.
                    The small magazine size is something you need to keep an eye on. The <a href="#akimbo">akimbo</a> power-up makes this weapon twice as deadly!  (1)
                </p>                        
            </td>
        </tr>            
        <tr>
            <td><img src="pics/weapon_assault.jpg" alt="Assault rifle"/></td>
            <td>
                <b>MTP-57 Assault Rifle</b><br />
                <p>
                    The large caliber deals a substantial amount of damage. A long barrel ensures accuracy even at high range. 
                    It can become difficult to control when shooting bursts of more than three bullets. (5)
                </p>                        
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><br /><br /><br /><img src="pics/weapon_sniper.jpg" alt="Sniper rifle"/></td>
            <td>
                <b>Precision Tech AD-81 Sniper Rifle</b><br />
                <p>
                    Semi-Automatic Sniper rifle, equipped with a 2x scope. The large caliber can do a frightful amount of damage. 
                    Though naturally most accurate when used with the scope, the highly ergonomic design allows the experienced shooter 
                    to operate it from the hip as well. 
                </p>
                <p> Not recommended on it's own for hand-to-hand combat, since it can take some time 
                    to recock the weapon. Headshot frags from this weapon produces a "gib" instead of a frag which counts for two frags, 
                    instead of one. Headshots also cause three times as much damage. (4)
                </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="pics/weapon_subgun.jpg" alt="Sub-machine gun"/></td>
            <td>
                <b>A-Ard 10 Sub-machine Gun</b><br />
                <p>
                    This weapon releases a deadly spray of bullets at a high rate of fire.
                    However, due to the short barrel and small caliber,
                    its man-stopping power is limited, and effectiveness ceases at longer ranges. (3)
                </p>
            </td>

            <td>
                <b>V-19 Combat Shotgun</b><br />
                <p>
                    7-round semi-automatic shotgun.  This powerful weapon can shred your opponents to pieces -
                    if you´re close enough.(2)
                </p>

            <td>
                <b>SAL-T3 Grenade</b><br />
                <p>
                    This grenade is your friend in mid range fights. Its timer is adjusted to two seconds which makes it quite 
                    useful for quick responses to your enemies fire bursts. Frags from this weapon produces a "gib" instead of a 
                    frag which counts for two frags, instead of one. (6)
                </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        The next time you spawn, you will be given the primary weapon you chose.
    </p>

    <h2>Items</h2>

        These are items you can pickup during the game to further your fragging ability:

                    This box supplies ammunition for the primary weapons. The exact contents are:
