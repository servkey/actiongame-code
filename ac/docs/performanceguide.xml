      Performance guide
    </h1>
	<p>
	  Getting the best performance possible from your hardware while running AssaultCube, without sacrificing 
	  too much quality is important to most players. A lot of newer hardware will run AssaultCube very well, 
	  with no changes neccesary, but some older hardware may need some optimisation to get a good result.
	  This guide details some ways on how to do this.<br />
	  <b>Note:</b> Although many settings can be changed in-game, for ease of explanation and understanding, this guide only 
	  details the way to change the settings through configuration files <b>outside</b> of the game.

	  The best way to get the best performance out of any 3D application is using the latest and correct drivers, with the 
	  correct settings. AssaultCube is no exception to this rule. If you have any problems running AssaultCube, always check 
	  your drivers first!
	</p>
	<p>
	  To get and install the latest and correct drivers, follow these steps...
	  <ol>
	    <li>
		  Find out the correct name/make/model of your video card.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Go to the driver/support section of your video card manufacturers website (i.e. 
		  <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html">nVidia</a>, <a href="http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html">ATi</a>,
		  <a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/">Intel</a>, etc) and download the latest and correct drivers for your model 
		  and operating system.
		</li>
		<li>
		   Install and configure the drivers as per the instructions given to you by the manufacturer.
		</li>
	  </ol>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Some operating systems and graphics cards have other special drivers and methods that you can explore for your drivers.  
	  Microsoft Windows users may benefit from <a href="http://www.omegadrivers.net/omega_drivers.php">Omega Drivers</a>, 
	  some nVidia Microsoft Windows users can try using <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/ntune_5.05.54.00.html">nTune</a>. 
	  Linux users might like <a href="http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html">EnvyNG</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Warning:</b> If you're using a laptop, you may need to consult your laptop manufacturer for drivers, as laptop display
	  drivers are heavily customised.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>Note:</b> None of these links or drivers are endorsed, maintained or supported by the AssaultCube team.<br /> 
	  Use these links at your own risk. We highly advise it to be best searching the forums and support pages for 
	  your operating system supplier or graphics card manufacturer if you are having problems with 3D graphics rendering.

	  Resolution
	</h3>
	<p>
	  Your resolution in-game determines the amount of detail on the screen. The higher the resolution you use, the more the
	  graphics card has to work.  If you are having problems with low frame rates, lag or stuttering, lowering the resolution
	  will yield the biggest result.<br />
	  Note: LCD panels typically work best at their native resolution rather than a bigger/smaller one.

	  Physical ways to increase your computers performance for AssaultCube are: Upgrading RAM, CPU power, Graphics cards or 
	  motherboards.<br />
	  To find out how to do this, please seek advice elsewhere. There are plenty of resources available online!
	</p>
	<p>
	  When running AssaultCube, it would be wise to turn off any un-needed applications, especially those that suck down CPU 
	  performance and graphics rendering. For example: Turn off compiz, music players, windows defender, etc. Also try turning 
	  down the graphics settings used by your operating system for everyday tasks.
