    <h1>Command-Line Options</h1>

    <p>
      In the file <i>assaultcube_server.bat</i> (or the respective .sh file in linux) you can add or
      change command line options:
    </p>


    <p>
      <span class="code">-d</span> This starts AssaultCube as a dedicatated server. The default is a non-dedicated server with only a single client in graphical mode. See the <a href="server.xml">Server Section</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-wX</span> sets desired screen width to X, default is <span class="code">-w640</span>
      <br />
      <span class="code">-hY</span> sets desired screen height to Y, default is <span class="code">-h480</span>
      <br />
      <span class="code">-t</span> runs windowed
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-zN</span> sets the z-buffer precision to N bits. This should be at least 24 or you may experience depth problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-bN</span> sets the screen to N bits per pixel
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-aN</span> sets FSAA (Full Scene AntiAliasing) to N samples, i.e. -a4 is 4xFSAA
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-vN</span> enables vsync if N is greater 0
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-uN</span> sets the server upstream bandwidth to N bytes per second. only set
      this parameter if you know what you are doing, specifying a wrong value is worse
      than not specifying it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-nS</span> sets the server description, for people pinging the server. usually
      does not need to be set if you have a descriptive domain name already, but if you
      set it, keep it short as it may otherwise be truncated, i.e. -nBobsInstagibServer

    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-iIP</span> sets the server ip to IP. this option is only useful for people
      running on machines with multiple network interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-mM</span> sets the master server to use for either server (registering) and
      client (updating) to M. M is the base url of the master server and has to end in
      a / and without a http:// prefix, the default is masterserver.cubers.net/cgi-bin/AssaultCube.pl/.
      If you want your server to be private and not report to the masterserver, use -mlocalhost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-pPASS</span> sets the server password to PASS. Only clients that use the command
      "password PASS" will be able to connect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="code">-cN</span> sets the maximum number of players that can play on this server
      to N (default 6). If more players try to connect they will get a "server full" message.
