        <h2>The Game</h2>
        
        <h3>Story</h3>
        
        <p>
            Well, there is no story. Bascially this game is about these two teams fighting each other:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>The Cubers Liberations Army (CLA)</b><br />

            <img src="pics/flag_cla.png" alt="CLA" style="float:right"/>
            
            Little is known about the goals and motivation of this small but feared Terrorist group. Their activities are 
            as diverse as their members. With ex-military, anarchists, religious fanatics, conspiracy theorists, hippies 
            stuck tripping, free&copy; software fanatics&trade;, or simply severely mental disordered persons or bored youngsters, this organization is a 
            pool for radicals from across the globe. Their operations range from simple annoyances (such as introducing 
            large amounts of mariuana-smoke into the air conditioners of offices or malls) to well planned gruesome 
            bombings, choosing civilians as well as politicians, lobbyists or religious leaders and their staff as 
            targets. <i>&ldquo;Terror for the sake of terror, for you all suck!&rdquo;</i> seems to be their motto.                   
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>The Rabid Viper Special Forces (RVSF)</b><br />

            <img src="pics/flag_rvsf.png" alt="RVSF" style="float:right"/> 
            
            An elite group of armed special forces, but not the kind you´d expect. These guys are battle worn fighters 
            and mercenairies, who might have been just a little too trigger happy and up for glory to fit into any other 
            kind of elite squad. Not suitable where lives are to be spared and private or public property to remain 
            unharmed. The backrounds and funders of this extravagant task-force remain well concealed, for obvious 
            reasons. Their primary targets are highly unpredictable terrorists and organized criminals such as the CLA 
            where intelligence, infiltration and stealth would be just a waste of time. <i>&ldquo;First shoot, then ask 
            questions, if anyone´s left to ask&rdquo;</i> is the primary approach to their job.  
        </p>

        <h3>Controls</h3>
        
        <p>
            This is the default controls setting:
        </p>

            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            <tr>

                <td>4</td><td>Knife</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            You can also assign custom keys to specific weapons. 
            Just modify the <i>config/autoexec.cfg</i> accordingly. Example:
        </p>
        
        <div class="code">
            bind f "primary"<br />
            bind e "secondary"<br />
            bind c "melee"<br />
            bind q "grenade"<br />
        </div>
        
        <p>
            You will find suggestions for more ergonomical key setups in this config file.
        </p>

        <h3>Weapons</h3>

        <p>
            There are seven weapons you can use to frag your enemies:
        </p>            

        <table id="guns">
            <tr>
                <td><img src="pics/weapon_knife.png" alt="knife"/></td>
                <td>
                    <b>Swiss Tech Combat Blade DR-88</b><br />
                    <p>
                        A sharp and swift blade. Your last ressort when you ran out of Ammo and your best friend
                        in humiliating snipers and campers.               
                    </p>                        
                </td>

           <tr>
                <td><img src="pics/weapon_pistol.png" alt="pistol"/></td>
                <td>
                    <b>Mk-77 Semi-Automatic Pistol</b><br />
                    <p>
                        You basic sidearm. A powerful resort weapon, yet typically less effective at range.
                        The small clip size is something you need to keep an eye on.                     
                    </p>                        
                </td>
            </tr>

                <td>
                    <b>MTP-57 Assault Rifle</b><br />
                    <p>
                        The large caliber deals a substantial amount of damage. A long barrel ensures accuracy even at high range. 
                        It can become difficult to control when shooting bursts of more than three bullets.
                    </p>                        
                </td>

                    <b>Precision Tech AD-81 Sniper Rifle</b><br />
                    <p>
                        Semi Automatic Sniper rifle, equipped with a 2x Scope. The large caliber can do a frightful amount of damage. 
                        Though naturally most accurate when used with the scope, the highly ergonomic design allows the experienced shooter to operate it from the hip as well. 
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>

                    <b>A-Ard 10 Submachine Gun</b><br />
                    <p>
                        This one releases a deadly spray of bullets at a high rate of fire.
                        However, due to the short barrel and small caliber,
                        it´s manstopping power is limited, and effectiveness ceases at longer ranges.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        8-round semi-automatic shotgun.  This powerful weapon can shred your opponents to pieces-
                        if you´re close enough.
                    </p>

                    <b>SAL-T3 Grenade</b><br />
                    <p>
                        This grenade is your friend in mid range fights. Its timer is adjusted to two seconds which makes it quite 
                        useful for quick responses to your enemies fire bursts.
