::ActionCube Mappers Readme::Before you start mapping, MAKE YOUR OWN <MAPNAME>.CFG !The config/default_map_settings.cfg is only an example andmight change with every release, so you might lose the layoutof your map !Use the defaul_map_settings.cfg as base for your own .cfg, comment'texture-lines' you won't use and uncomment those you want. Choosewhich skymap you d'like, etc.Note the comments on particular mapmodel´s usage.:Maps for the ActionCube Project:If you want send us the maps you will make, you need to read the following lines. These rules/definitions are necessary because the maps that come with anActionCube release should be high-grade.- AC maps should look a bit grim, dusky .At the moment the texture set is by no means perfect,   so choosing the right texture for the job might take some time.- The theme should be industrial/realistic setting	You can mix them with nature-stuff when we have done some 	nature-mapmodels (plants,trees,etc)- Be frugal with lights:	- no heavy lights	- dont use _some_ different colors for lights                - No dark corners/places for campers- Be frugal with mapmodels:	- mapmodels slow down the gamespeed, thats a problem on older machines	- place them well, without repeating                - don´t use a mapmodel just because it´s there, it must be somewhat reasonable                 -less is more if placed well ;) - There _must_ be one start place for each (2) teams.	The map should be 'a line' between these place, there must be more than	one way to rush from the one place to the other, like (as example) 	cs maps.- Own textures and mapmodels:	feel free to include custom textures/mapmodels, but be aware that they might need to be	discussed with the ChiefMapper/AssistantChiefMapper.                Any custom stuff you want to use must either be totally free to use or made by yourself. You must include                the original authors copyright notes, and have author´s permission to use if required.	- Desired average wqd: 2000-3000 (leaves enough room for models)	Absolute maximum wqd  :6000 (special cases might be subject to discussion).-> Check the maps that are already included, your map should have a layout somewhat simillar to this.General Tips : Use solids wisely to allow for a map of reasonable size. Due to more mapmodels and higher player/hudgun polycount performance                           is very important.                           Leave enough room for strafing. Intended to be a fast paced game enough space to strafe around is neccesairy.                          While building the rough layout it is a good idea to spam the whole level with small, high contrast light sources                         (2/3/4 255 lights) to simulate a highly detailed scene regarding wqd count.                         Replace those lights when going into details.                         The current texture set is somewhat sensitive to very bright light, a good effect can be achieved by using  (7-12  100-180) raduis/strengh  lights  to                          add some "ambient" lighning first , and use smaller 2/3 255 for the highlights (where there are lamps/lamp models)                            by no means use the L button please. :)                             IMPORTANT: Informations how to join ActionCube as mapper and how to send us your maps are described in doc/AC_mappers.txt
