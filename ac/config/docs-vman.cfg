docremark [In both cases, the corner will orient itself automatically depending on its neighbours, behaviour with other configurations than the 2 above is unspecified. Since the latter configuration generates possibly 2 floor and 2 ceiling levels, up to 4 textures are used: for example for the 2 floors the higher one will of the cube itself, and the lower one of a neighbouring low cube. You can make bigger corners at once by issuing "corner" on grid aligned 2x2/4x4/8x8 selections, with equal size solid blocks next to them.]

docremark [Default keys are the six keys above the cursor keys, which each 2 of them cycle one type (and numpad 7/4 for upper).]
docremark [The way this works is slightly strange at first, but allows for very fast texture assignment. All textures are in 3 individual lists for each type (both wall kinds treated the same), and each time a texture is used, it is moved to the top of the list. So after a bit of editing, all your most frequently used textures will come first when pressing these keys, and the most recently used texture is set immediately when you press the forward key for the type. These lists are saved with the map. make a selection (including wall bits) and press these keys to get a feel for what they do.]

docident [edittoggle] [switches between map edit mode and normal.]
docremark [In map edit mode you can select bits of the map by clicking or dragging your crosshair on the floor or ceiling (using the "attack" identifier, normally MOUSE1), then use the identifiers below to modify the selection. While in edit mode, physics and collision don't apply (noclip), and key repeat is ON. Note that if you fly outside the map, cube still renders the world as if you were standing on the floor directly below the camera.]

docident [heightfield] [Marks the current selection as a heightfield.]
docargument [T] [an integer denoting the type] [0 (floor), 2 (ceiling)] [0]
docremark [marks the current selection as a heightfield, with T being floor or ceiling, as above. A surface marked as heightfield will use the vdelta values (see below) of its 4 corners to create a sloped surface. To mark a heightfield as normal again (ignoring vdelta values, set or not) use "solid 0". Default keys are h (floor) and i (ceiling).]
docremark [Heightfields should be made the exact size that is needed, not more not less. The most important reason for this is that cube automatically generates "caps" (side-faces for heightfields) only on the borders of the heightfield. This also means if you have 2 independent heightfields accidentally touch each other, you will not get correct caps. Also, a heightfield is slightly slower to render than a non-heightfield floor or ceiling. Last but not least, a heightfield should have all the same baseheight (i.e. the height determined by a normal editheight operation) to get correct results.]

docident [lightscale] [Used to finetune the "overbright lighting" rendering feature when enabled.]
docargument [N] [the brightness of the scene] [min 1/max 100/default 4]

The default is located in packages/misc/notexture.jpg (not in packages/textures - where custom ones must reside!)]
docexample [loadnotexture] [Reset to default]
docexample [loadnotexture "makke/black.jpg"] [Any missing texture will show up black]

docident [loadsky] [Loads a skymap for a map.]
docargument [P] [path to the six skybox textures] [string] [0]
docremark [The available skymaps reside in packages/textures/skymaps/..]

docexample [loadsky "textures/skymaps/makke/mountain"] []

docident [mapenlarge] [Enlarges the current map.]
docremark [This command will make the current map 1 power of two bigger. So a 6 size map (64x64 units) it will become a 7 map (128x128), with the old map in the middle (from 32-96) and the new areas solid.]

docident [mapmodel] [Registers a mapmodel that can be placed in maps.]
docargument [R] [The square radius of the bounding box.] [Integer] [0]
docargument [H] [The height of the bounding box.] [Integer] [0]
docargument [Z] [The initial height offset from the ground.] [Integer] [0]
docargument [0] [This integer is redundant. Leave it at zero so you don't break the command.] [0] [0]
docargument [N] [The name of the map model] [string] [0]
docremark [A mapmodel registered with this command can be placed in a map using the 'newent mapmodel' command. The bounding box is an invisible force surrounding the model, allowing players to collide against it, instead of walking through the mapmodel. For more information about this command, read mapediting5.xml.]
docremark [Example: mapmodel 4 2 4 0 "modelname"]
docremark [This mapmodel has a bounding box of 8x8x2 in size (X/Y/Z) and by default hovers 4 units above ground.]

docident [mapmodelreset] [Resets the mapmodel slots/indices to 0 for the subsequent "mapmodel" commands.]

docident [mapsound] [Defines a mapsound.]
docargument [N] [Path to the sound file] [] [0]
docargument [M] [Maximum simultaneous sounds] [default -1 (unlimited)] [0]
docremark [Registers the sound as a map-specific sound. These map-specific sounds may currently only be used with "sound" entities within a map. The first map sound registered in a map has slot/index number 0 and increases afterwards.]

docident [mapsoundreset] [Resets the mapsound slots/indices to 0 for the subsequent "mapsound" commands.]
docremark [Each subsequent mapsound command increases it again. See config/default_map_settings.cfg for an example.]

docremark [Note that this entity is only rendered as flag if the current game mode is CTF.]

docident [newent grenades] [Adds a new grenades item.]

docident [newent health] [Adds a new health item.]

docident [newent ladder] [Adds a ladder entity.]
docargument [H] [the height of the ladder] [integer] [0]
docremark [Note that this entity is used for physics only, to create a visual ladder you will need to add a mapmodel entity too.]

docargument [Z] [Extra elevation above ground] [Integer] [0]
docargument [T] [The map texture to use (optional)] [Integer] [0]
docremark [The mapmodel identifier is the desired map model which is defined by the 'mapmodel' command. The order in which the mapmodel is placed in the map config file defines the mapmodel identifier. The map texture refers to a texture which is defined by the 'texture' command, if omitted the models default skin will be used. The 'mapmodel' and 'texture' commands are placed in the map config normally. Mapmodels are more expensive than normal map geometry, so do not use insane amounts of them to replace normal geometry.]

docident [newent pistol] [Adds a pistol magazine item.]

docident [newent playerstart] [Adds a new spawn spot.]
docremark [The yaw is taken from the current camera yaw.]

docident [newent sound] [Adds a sound entity.]
docargument [N] [the sound to play] [integer] [0]
docargument [R] [the radius] [] [0]
docargument [S] [the size] [default 0] [0]
docargument [V] [the volume] [default 255] [0]
docremark [Will play map-specific sound so long as the player is within the radius. However, only up to the max uses allowed for N (specified in the mapsound command) will play, even if the player is within the radius of more N sounds than the max. By default (size 0), the sound is a point source. Its volume is maximal at the entity's location, and tapers off to 0 at the radius. If size is specified, the volume is maximal within the specified size, and only starts tapering once outside this distance. Radius is always defined as distance from the entity's location, so a size greater than or equal to the radius will just make a sound that is always max volume within the radius, and off outside.]
docremark [A sound entity can be either ambient or non-ambient. Ambient sounds have no specific direction, they are 'just there'. Non-ambient sounds however appear to come from a specific direction (stereo panning). If S is set to 0, the sound is a single point and will therefore be non-ambient. However if S is greater than 0, the sound will be ambient as it covers a specified area instead of being a single point.]

docident [newmap] [Creates a new map.]
docargument [S] [the size of the new map] [6..12] [0]
docremark [The new map has 2^S cubes. For S, 6 is small, 7 medium, 8 large.]

docident [nextclosestent] [In edit mode, when you have an entity selected, this causes you to select the next-closest one.]

docident [nextplayerstart] [In edit mode, changes your view to the next "player start" entity.]

docident [paste] [Pastes a previously copied selection.]
docremark [To paste a selection back requires a same size selection at the destination location. If it is not the same size the selection will be resized automatically prior to the paste operation (with the red dot as anchor), which is easier for large selections.]
docremark [hotkey v]

docident [perlin] [Generates a perlin noise landscape in the current selection.]
docargument [S] [the scale, frequency of the features] [default is 10] [0]
docargument [E] [the random seed] [integer] [0]
docargument [C] [cube size, how many cubes to generate a surface for at once (unused)] [] [0]
docremark [Keep the seed the same to create multiple perlin areas which fit with each other, or use different numbers if to create alternative random generations.]

docident [replace] [Repeats the last texture edit throughout the map.]
docremark [The way it works is intuitive: simply edit any texture anywhere, then using "replace" will replace all textures throughout the map in the same way (taking into account whether it was a floor/wall/ceil/upper too). If the there was more than one "old" texture in your selection, the one nearest to the red dot is used. This operation can't be undone.]

docident [savemap] [Saves the current map.]
docargument [M] [file name of the map, see command 'map' for the naming scheme] [string] [0]
docremark [savemap makes a versioned backup (mapname_N.BAK) if a map by that name already exists. If the name argument is omitted, it is saved under the current map name.]
docremark [Where you store a map depends on the complexity of what you are creating: if its a single map (maybe with its own .cfg) then the "base" package is the best place. If its multiple maps or a map with new media (textures etc.) its better to store it in its own package (a directory under "packages"), which makes distributing it less messy.]

docident [select] [Selects the given area, as if dragged with the mouse.]
docargument [X] [the X coordinate] [] [0]
docargument [Y] [the Y coordinate] [] [0]
docargument [XS] [the length along the X axis] [] [0]
docargument [XY] [the length along the Y axis] [] [0]
docremark [This command is useful for making complex geometry-generating scripts. The current dimensions of the selection (either created by the user or this command) are in the variables selx, sely, selxs and selys and can also be read/modified.]
docremark [Coordinates are as follows: after a "newmap 6" the top-left corner (the one where the red dot points) are (8,8), the opposite corner is (56,56) (or (120,120) on a "newmap 7" etc.).]

docident [selectionflip] [Flip the selected part of the map over the specified axis.]
docargument [AXIS] [X or Y] [] [0]

docident [selectionrotate] [Rotate the selected part of the map in 90 degree steps.]
docargument [D] [steps] [] [0]
docremark [To rotate clockwise, use a positive number of steps. Note that only quadratic selections can be rotated by 90 degrees.]

docident [selx] [In edit mode, sets the x-axis of your selection in relation to the map layout.]
docargument [N] [0 ... Map max]

docident [setwpyaw] [Stores the current player yaw in the current waypoint.]

docident [shadowyaw] [Shadow yaw specifies the angle at which shadow stencils are drawn on a map.]
docargument [D] [The angle in degrees to rotate the stencil shadows] [0...360, default is 45] [0]
docremark [When specifying shadowyaw, remember that the default angle is 45 degrees. The example below would make the shadows appear at 90 degrees (45 degrees more to the left).]

docident [showedithide] [Lists all entities you have set to hidden.]

docident [showmip] [Toggles between showing what parts of the scenery are rendered.]
docremark [Shows what parts of the scenery are rendered using what size cubes, and outputs some statistics about it. This can give map editors hints as to what architecture to align, textures to change, etc.]

docident [showmodelclipping] [In edit mode, determines whether to display clipping applied to mapmodels.]
docargument [B] [1 or 0] [yes or no]
docremark [Applies only to mapmodels, and is shown as green boundaries. The yellow boundaries are unaffected by this.]

docident [slope] [Makes a slope out of the current selection.]
docargument [X] [x delta step] [integer] [0]
docargument [Y] [y delta step] [integer] [0]
docremark [The selection must be a heightfield before this command can be used. The steps specify the slope with the red vertex as left-top, i.e. "slope 1 2" will make a slope that increases just 1 step from left to right, and is slightly steeper from top to bottom. "slope -6 0" decreases steeply from left to right, and does not slope at all from top to bottom. Note that like the vdelta command, an increasing vdelta goes further away from the player, regardless of floor or ceiling.]

docident [solid] [makes the current selection all solid (i.e. wall) or all non-solid.]
docargument [B] [an integer denoting the solid-ness] [0 (non-solid), 1..* (solid)] [0]

docargument [0] [This is a redundant value. Always leave this value as 0 here so it doesn't    break your configurations.] [0] [0]
docargument [F] [File name of the texture to bind] [String] [0]
docremark [Binds the texture indicated in the filename to the current texture slot and increments the slot number.]

docident [texturereset] [Sets the texture slots/indicies to 0 for the subsequent "texture" commands.]
docremark [Each subsequent texture command increases it again. See config/default_map_settings.cfg for an example.]

docident [undo] [Multi-level undo of any of the changes caused by editing operations]
docremark [hotkey u]

docident [undomegs] [Sets the number of megabytes used for the undo buffer.]
docargument [N] [number of megabytes, default is 1] [integer] [0]
docremark [undo's work for any size areas, so the amount of undo steps per megabyte is more for small areas than for big ones (a megabyte fits 280 undo steps on a 16x16 area, but only 4 steps on a 128x128 area).]

docident [unsetjumpwp] [Clears the selected waypoint's status as a place where a bot should jump.]

docident [vdelta] [changes the vdelta value of the current selection]
docargument [N] [vdelta value] [] [0]
docremark [Note that unlike all other editing functions, this function doesn't affect a cube, but its top-left vertex (market by the dot in the editing cursor). So to edit a N * M heightfield, you will likely have to edit the vdelta of (N+1) * (M+1) cubes, i.e. you have to select 1 row and 1 column more in the opposite direction of the red dot to affect all the vertices of a heightfield of a given size (try it, it makes sense :)]
docremark [A floor delta offsets vertices to beneath the level set by editheight (and a ceil delta to above). Delta offsets have a precision of a quarter of a unit, however you should use non-unitsize vertices only to touch other such vertices. Default keys are 8 and 9 to decrease/increase the vdelta.]

docident [waterlevel] [Sets the global water level for the map.]
docargument [H] [the water level] [integer] [0]
docremark [Every cube that has a lower floor than the water level will be rendered with a nice wavy water alpha texture. Water physics will be applied to any entity located below it.]
docremark [Performance notes: water is rendered for a whole square encapsulating all visible water areas in the map (try flying above the map in edit mode to see how). So the most efficient water is a single body of water, or multiple water areas that are mostly not visible from each other. Players can influence how accurate the water is rendered using the "watersubdiv" command (map config).]

docident [wpclear] [Clears all waypoints.]

docident [wpflood] [Floods the map with bot waypoints.]

docident [wpinfo] [makes waypoints visible and either turns on or off the waypoint information display.]
