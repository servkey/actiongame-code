Add things that have changed since 0.93 in here, so that when release time comes around, it is much easier to 
record what has changed since it's already recorded here. 

Things not to add: 	Bugs created in 1.0 (since they should get fixed during the development).
			Documentation changes --> Releases are expected to always have new documentation.
