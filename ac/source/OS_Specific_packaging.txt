Put notes in here about what should be added, taken away, or changed 
for specific Operating Systems, when AssaultCube gets packaged and released.


WINDOWS
-------


LINUX
-----
 * In "menus.cfg" change the line:
	menuitem "Quit"	"quit"
   To say:
	menuitem "Quit"	"fullscreen 0; quit"
   Why? This will make linux change AC to windowed mode, and then try and quit. 
   Then, if something goes wrong during the quit, more control is available (mouse doesn't get locked, etc)


OS X
----
