5sqtunnelroad.jpg was originally by:
		Crack dot Com (The Golgotha Team)

According to Golgotha's credits, these textures were most likely created by Kevin Tyler, 
Stephen Wilson or Johnathan Clark:

These files were then modified to fit AssaultCube and added to the game by:
	Mike "MitaMAN" Poeschl (mitaman1@optonline.net)

Read Wikipedia for more information about the fate of Golgotha:

These textures are free, released into the public domain by the since-abandoned "Golgotha" 
computer game, which means they can be used for just about anything.
You can read more about it being free, to the public domain below. This excerpt was taken from:

Is everything free?
-------------------
YES! Free as in "free beer" and free as in "free speech." You can do anything you like with 
the source, graphics, music, and level files, including: sell it, include parts or all of 
it in your project, post it, copy it, and change it to your heart's content. The only 
restrictions lay in the code which we did not write and therefore do not own (i.e. the MP3
decoder code ). The author of MPG123 allows free use of that code for non profit use.

This code and data is "public domain" not to be confused with code released under a license
such GPL. GPL sets limits on what you can do the code and conditions on it's use and we do not.

The trademarks "Crack dot Com" and "Golgotha" remain the property of crack.com.
