Don't know how to open this map in AssaultCube?

Friendly explanations @ http://www.ri-ac.co.nr/runmap





Mapname: ac_toxic

Version: 0.9

Released: Tuesday, 25th December, 2007.





Included files with this zip:

	1) ac_toxic.cgz

	2) ac_toxic.cfg

	3) readme_ri_toxic.txt





ac_toxic is RandumIdiot's first good map ever. High quality, nice 

layout. It has been released on the 25th of December, as a Christmas 

present to the AssaultCube community.



ac_toxic started out as an idea to create a half indoor, half outdoor 

map for ac that contained high up mapmodel's that players could walk 

around on to spectate the game (this seemed especially useful, so that 

clan members could judge a players techniques and skills before 

allowing a player to join the clan). This map was planned to be called 

ri_spectate.



Some time later, and I discovered that, spectate mode in AssaultCube 

1.0 was going to become reality and that version 1.0 was not too far 

away from release. This meant that the idea was scrapped. The map lost 

all of its spectator geometry and the map continued under the new name 

'ri_new' while I decided upon a new name.



So, over the past few months, this map has transformed from a crappy 

"spectate" idea, into this high quality, nice layout, ri_toxic map :)





...and then, makkE told me he likes this map and that it can be 

included in the offical AssaultCube 0.94 distribution. So, the map has

been given a config file and has been changed slightly to be awesome :P



Expect this map to be improved upon later :D





Enjoy!





Want a story?

_____________

Once upon a time, there were people that wrecked havock and created a 

huge mess, destroying buildings, etc etc... they were known as RVSF

... and of course there were the terrorists, known as CLA.



CLA found a nice, recently abandoned storage complex. Most of 

the stuff stored there had been removed.. and that's what made it so 

perfect... Perfect for what? Why dumping toxic waste of course!



CLA had only just started dumping waste (which they were making 

thousands of dollars off) when RVSF got jealous and deployed themselves 

into the abandoned complex to gain control of it and carry out CLA's 

plans for their own profit.



What followed that? Why, havock of course!
